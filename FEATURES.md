## Visual Component Builder

The Visual Component Builder is the core feature of OnAim-Builder, providing a sophisticated drag-and-drop interface for creating responsive web applications without writing code.

### üñ•Ô∏è Dual View Development

**What it is**: A revolutionary approach to responsive design that allows simultaneous editing of desktop and mobile layouts in a single interface.
